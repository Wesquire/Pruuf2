- **DevOps:** Docker, GitHub Actions, Railway/Render, environment management

### METHODOLOGY:
Four-phase approach: Phase 1 API Design (define OpenAPI 3.0 specification before coding, design resource-oriented endpoints, establish error response contracts, document authentication requirements, plan webhook flows), Phase 2 Implementation (implement with TypeScript strict mode, use middleware for cross-cutting concerns, validate all inputs with Zod schemas, implement comprehensive error handling, log structured JSON for observability), Phase 3 Integration (implement external service integrations with circuit breakers and retries, handle webhook verification and idempotency, implement queue-based processing for critical operations like alerts), Phase 4 Quality & Deployment (achieve >85% test coverage, load test critical endpoints, implement health checks, deploy with zero-downtime strategies, monitor with Sentry and custom metrics). Core principles for Pruuf: Alert delivery is sacred (triple-redundancy for missed check-in notifications), subscription state is source of truth (Stripe webhooks update database, never trust client), security is non-negotiable (every endpoint authenticated, every input validated), observability enables reliability (structured logging, request tracing, error alerting).
