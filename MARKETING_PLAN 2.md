**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** December 2025
**Document Owner:** Marketing Team

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Pruuf is a compassionate daily check-in safety application targeting adult children (Contacts) who want peace of mind about their elderly parents (Members). Our marketing strategy emphasizes **value-led messaging** over price-led messaging, positioning Pruuf as an affordable alternative to expensive medical alert systems while maintaining premium positioning through emotional benefits.

**Core Pricing:**
- $3.99/month (monthly subscription)
- $29/year (annual subscription - 39% savings)
- 30-day free trial (starts when first Member onboards)

## 1. TARGET AUDIENCE

### Primary Audience: Adult Children (Contacts)
**Demographics:**
- Age: 35-65 years old
- Relationship: Have elderly parent(s) living independently
- Technology comfort: Moderate to high (daily smartphone users)
- Financial situation: Middle to upper-middle class
- Geographic: Initially US-focused

**Psychographics:**
- Constantly worried about elderly parent's wellbeing
- Feel guilty about not calling every day
- Want to respect parent's independence
- Willing to pay for peace of mind
- Value simplicity and reliability

**Pain Points:**
- Daily "Is Mom okay?" anxiety
- Awkward daily check-in calls that feel forced
- Parent refuses medical alert pendants (stigma)
- Life Alert too expensive ($30-50/month)
- Location tracking feels invasive/dystopian

### Secondary Audience: Elderly Adults (Members)
**Note:** We do NOT market directly to elderly users. They are introduced through Contacts (family members). Marketing should focus on making the value proposition clear to adult children who will advocate for adoption.

### Competitor Landscape

## 3. PRICING PSYCHOLOGY & MESSAGING

### Why $3.99 Works

**Psychological Anchors:**
- "Under $4" is a powerful mental threshold
- Comparable to a cup of coffee
- 92% cheaper than Life Alert's $50/month
- Affordable enough to be a "no-brainer"

**Framing Options (Use in Marketing):**
| Frame | Message |
|-------|---------|
| Monthly | "Less than $4/month" |
| Weekly | "About a dollar a week" |
| Daily | "Just 13 cents a day" |
| Comparative | "Less than your morning coffee" |
| vs Life Alert | "92% less than traditional alert systems" |

### Annual Pricing Strategy ($29/year)

**Psychological Benefits:**
- Creates urgency for monthly tier ("Why not just get annual?")
- Appeals to deal-seekers (39% savings)
- Reduces churn (annual commitment)
- Five months free positioning

**Marketing Messages:**
- "Save 39% with annual billing"
- "Get 5 months free with annual"
- "$29/year = unlimited peace of mind"

### Value-Led Messaging (NOT Price-Led)

**Wrong Approach:**
> "Only $3.99/month!"

**Right Approach:**
> "Daily peace of mind that Mom is safe. One tap. That's it."

**Lead with emotional benefit, follow with price:**
1. Hook: Emotional pain point
2. Solution: How Pruuf solves it
3. Proof: Social proof/testimonials
4. Price: As the "easy yes"

---

## 4. MESSAGING FRAMEWORK

### Primary Tagline Options
1. "Peace of mind, one tap at a time"
2. "Know they're okay. Every day."
3. "Daily check-ins. Dignified safety."
4. "The simple way to know they're safe"

### Message Hierarchy

**Tier 1: Emotional Hook (Headlines)**
- "Stop wondering if Mom is okay"
- "She presses one button. You get peace of mind."
- "The daily call you don't have to make"
- "Safety without the stigma"

**Tier 2: How It Works (Subheadlines)**
- "Your loved one taps 'I'm OK' once a day. You get instant confirmation."
- "Miss a check-in? Get immediate alerts so you can take action."

**Tier 3: The Easy Yes (CTA + Price)**
- "Try free for 30 days. $3.99/month after."
- "Less than $4/month for daily peace of mind"
- "Start your free trial. No credit card required."

### Tone & Voice Guidelines
- **Warm, not clinical:** "Great job!" not "Check-in recorded"
- **Empathetic, not guilt-tripping:** "Stay connected" not "Don't neglect your parents"
- **Confident, not aggressive:** "Peace of mind" not "Never worry again"
- **Simple, not dumbed down:** Clear language that respects intelligence

## 5. CHANNEL STRATEGY

**Social Proof Collection**

### Phase 2: Targeted Digital (Months 6-12)

**Facebook/Instagram Ads**

- Creative: Emotional video testimonials
- Budget: $5-10 CAC target

**Google Ads**
- Keywords: "check on elderly parents app", "life alert alternative"

### Phase 3: Partnerships (Year 2+)

- Emphasize risk: "Without payment, you won't know if [Member] misses check-in"
- Easy payment: One-tap Apple Pay / Google Pay
- Annual upsell: "Save 39% with annual billing"

### Expected Metrics

## 8. OBJECTION HANDLING

### "My parent won't use another app"
> "Pruuf is designed for seniors who struggle with technology. One giant button. One tap. That's it. Most parents find it easier than texting."

### "What if they forget to check in?"
> "They can enable a daily reminder at their preferred time. And if they do forget, that's exactly when you need to know—so you can check on them."

### "Life Alert is more comprehensive"
> "Life Alert is great for emergencies. Pruuf is for daily peace of mind. Many families use both—Pruuf costs less than one month of Life Alert per year."

### "Why should I pay when I can just call?"
> "You absolutely can. But Pruuf gives your parent agency—they're reassuring you, not being checked on. Most families find it preserves dignity and reduces the burden on both sides."

### "$3.99 seems expensive"
> "It's less than a coffee per week for daily confirmation your loved one is safe. Most families find it's the easiest $3.99 they spend each month."
